# Birthday Paradox Simulator

This Python script simulates the birthday paradox, which demonstrates the surprising probability of two people sharing the same birthday in a group. The program utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to explore this concept.

## Overview

The birthday paradox states that in a group of N people, the probability of two people having the same birthday is higher than one might intuitively expect. This script allows users to input the number of birthdays they want to generate and runs simulations to estimate the likelihood of a shared birthday within the group.

## Features

- Generates random birthdays for a specified number of people.
- Simulates the occurrence of shared birthdays using Monte Carlo simulation.
- Displays the results of the simulations, including the probability of shared birthdays.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script `birthday_paradox.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to input the number of birthdays to generate.
5. The script will display the generated birthdays and the results of the simulations.

## Credits

This project is inspired by the "Big Book of Small Python Projects" by Al Sweigart. The concept and implementation of the birthday paradox simulation are based on the exercises presented in the book.
